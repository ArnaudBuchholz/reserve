This sample shows basic features of REserve.

## How to start

* `node ../.. --config static.json` to see how to server static pages
* `node static.js` the same static pages served with express
* `node ../.. --config basic_authent.json` uses a custom handler to implement basic authentication (just use the name `arnaud`)
